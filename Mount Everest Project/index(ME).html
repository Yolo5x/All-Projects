            <li>
    <b>Climbing Season:</b> The main climbing season for Mount Everest typically occurs in the spring (April-May) and, to a lesser extent, in the autumn (September-October). In 2024, the spring season saw an estimated 600-700 climbers reach the summit.
            </li>
            <li>
    <b>Summit Attempts: </b> The 2024 spring climbing season was marked by high numbers of summit attempts, continuing the trend of increasing climber traffic in recent years. However, exact figures for the number of summit successes in 2024 won't be finalized until later in the year.
           </li>
           <li>
    <b>Record Highs: </b> The number of people attempting to climb Everest has increased dramatically over the last few decades, and there have been increasing concerns about overcrowding, environmental impact, and safety.
           </li>
           <li>
    <b>Environmental Concerns: </b>Efforts to clean up Everest continue, with large numbers of discarded gear and trash being removed each year. The Nepali government has increased focus on mitigating environmental degradation, but challenges remain.
            </li>
            <li>
    <b>Climbing Deaths:</b> Climbing fatalities on Everest continue, though the death rate has decreased in recent years due to better weather forecasting, improved routes, and better equipment. In 2023, a handful of fatalities occurred, but the number was still lower than during the peak of overcrowding issues in the 2010s.
             </li>
             <li>
    <b>Infrastructure:</b> The infrastructure in the Everest region, including base camps, routes, and helicopter rescues, has been improving, which helps more climbers access the summit safely. However, logistical challenges like avalanches, altitude sickness, and unpredictable weather continue to pose risks.
            <li>
    <b>Political and Legal Issues: </b>In 2024, Nepal introduced new regulations regarding permits and the requirement for climbers to have previous high-altitude experience before being allowed to attempt Everest. This was in response to the increasing number of inexperienced climbers and accidents.
           </li>
           <li>
    <b>Scientific Research: </b>Mount Everest is still a focus for scientific research, with studies on climate change, geology, glaciology, and high-altitude biology ongoing.
