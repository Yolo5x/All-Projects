          <h1>Introduction about Monkeys</h1>
        </header>
        <p>Monkeys play a crucial role in ecosystems as seed dispersers and as part of the food chain. Their intelligence and curiosity make them a source of fascination for scientists and animal enthusiasts alike. From the playful antics of squirrel monkeys to the contemplative behavior of macaques, monkeys have been a symbol of adaptability and resilience, capturing human interest for centuries.</p>
        <p>Monkey Habitats & Environments</p>
        <div class="li-box">
        <li>Tropical Rainforests – Found in South America, Africa, and Asia, these forests provide a rich source of food (fruits, leaves, and insects).</li>
        <li>Savannas & Grasslands – Some species, like baboons, thrive in open areas where they forage on the ground</li>
        <li>Mountains & Highlands – Species such as the Japanese macaque survive in colder temperatures with thick fur for insulation.</li>
        <li>Mangroves & Swamps – Proboscis monkeys in Borneo live in wetland areas, relying on aquatic plants and trees for survival.</li>
        <li>Urban & Human-Altered Environments – Some monkeys, like macaques, adapt to cities but often face human conflicts.</li>

        </div>
        
        <p>Monkeys are fascinating <code>primates</code> known for their intelligence, agility, and diverse behaviors. Found in tropical rainforests, grasslands, and even urban environments, they are divided into two main groups: Old World monkeys (native to Africa and Asia) and New World monkeys (native to the Americas). With over 260 species, monkeys exhibit remarkable variation in size, appearance, and social structure, making them one of the most adaptable and widely distributed primate groups.<p>

          <h1>Facts about Monkeys</h1>
        </header>
        <p>Monkeys display extraordinary traits, such as their use of tools, advanced problem-solving skills, and complex social hierarchies. Some species, like the capuchin, are known to use sticks or stones to gather food, showcasing their cognitive abilities. Monkeys have diverse diets ranging from fruits and leaves to insects and small animals, depending on their habitat. They communicate through a variety of vocalizations, facial expressions, and body language, underscoring their sophisticated social interactions.</p>
        <p>One intriguing fact about monkeys is their ability to recognize themselves in mirrors, a trait observed in species like the <code>rhesus macaque</code>. This self-awareness highlights their advanced cognitive functions. Additionally, monkeys often live in tight-knit social groups, where grooming plays a vital role in building bonds and reducing stress, showcasing the importance of community in their lives.</p>

        <p>Threats to Monkey Populations</p>
        <div class="li-box">
          <li>Deforestation – Habitat destruction from logging, agriculture, and urban expansion.</li>
          <li>Hunting & Poaching – Monkeys are hunted for bushmeat, traditional medicine, and the illegal pet trade.</li>
          <li>Climate Change – Rising temperatures, habitat loss, and food scarcity affect monkey populations</li>
          <li>Human-Wildlife Conflict – Urban expansion forces monkeys into human settlements, leading to culling or relocation.</li>
          <li>Disease Transmission – Close contact with humans increases the spread of zoonotic diseases.</li>

          <h1>Evolution</h1>
        </header>
        <p>Monkeys evolved approximately 25 to 30 million years ago, branching off from their common ancestors with other primates. New World monkeys, such as spider monkeys, diverged from Old World monkeys millions of years ago, resulting in distinctive traits like prehensile tails in the former. The evolutionary adaptations in monkeys have allowed them to thrive in various ecosystems, from dense rainforests to arid savannas.

</p>
        <p>The <code>evolutionary</code> split between monkeys and apes marked the development of distinct physical and behavioral traits. While monkeys retained tails for balance and mobility in trees, apes evolved with larger brains and more complex behaviors. Fossil evidence and genetic studies have shed light on these evolutionary pathways, deepening our understanding of primate diversity and their shared ancestry with humans.</p>

        <div class="li-box">
          <li>Strengthen laws against monkey trafficking and hunting.</li>
          <li>Raise awareness about the impact of the illegal pet trade.</li>

        <p>Monkeys have also been instrumental in medical research, aiding in the study of diseases like polio and Ebola. However, their susceptibility to certain pathogens makes them vulnerable in captivity and the wild. Increased interaction with humans due to habitat encroachment has led to the emergence of new zoonotic diseases, underscoring the need for ethical research practices and conservation strategies.</p>
        <p>Monkeys, like humans, are susceptible to various diseases, including zoonotic ones that can transfer between species. Viruses such as simian immunodeficiency virus <code>(SIV)</code> and diseases like tuberculosis can affect both monkeys and humans. Research into these diseases has provided valuable insights into human medicine, including advancements in understanding viruses and vaccine development.</p>

        </header>
        <p>Environmental changes, including deforestation and climate change, pose significant threats to monkey populations. Habitat destruction forces many species to migrate or adapt to new environments, leading to a loss of biodiversity. Conservation efforts, including habitat preservation and wildlife corridors, are essential to ensure the survival of these primates in the face of escalating environmental challenges.</p>
        <p>Increased human activities, such as agriculture and <code>urbanization</code>, are fragmenting monkey habitats, isolating populations and reducing genetic diversity. Some species, like the golden lion tamarin, face critical endangerment due to these pressures. Conservation organizations are employing innovative solutions, including reforestation projects and community education, to combat the negative impact of environmental changes on monkey populations.
